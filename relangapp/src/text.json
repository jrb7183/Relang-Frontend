    "About": "This application aims to help you break free of your latent habits when approaching new conlangs. Relang Generator analyzes a variety of features from your previous protolangs to find commonalities between them. Then, it suggests an outline for a protolang that breaks away from those commonalities. This outline will allow you to go out of your conlanging comfort zone and explore linguistic phenomena that you may have avoided in the past, subconsciously or otherwise. <b>While Relang can generate many aspects of a protolang, it is first and foremost meant for inspiration.</b>"
